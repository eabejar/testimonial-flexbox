            <p class="text-b">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
                in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.
              </p>
              <p class="text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
